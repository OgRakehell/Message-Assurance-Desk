# Problem Context

When a customer reports that an OTP or transaction alert was not received, the investigation process typically involves:

Manually querying the core banking system for account and phone number details

Checking separate vendor portals for OTP and SMS delivery status

Interpreting inconsistent delivery responses

Escalating issues via email with limited traceability

This process:

Is time-consuming for CSOs

Lacks standardization

Creates poor visibility across teams

Delays customer feedback

Makes auditing and reporting difficult

Despite the technical sophistication of the underlying systems, the operational workflow remains largely manual.
