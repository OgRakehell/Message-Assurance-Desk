### Centralized OTP & SMS Resolution Workflow for Retail Banking
###OTP and SMS delivery failures are among the most frequent and frustrating customer complaints in retail banking.
While the technical systems involved are complex, the operational response to these issues is often fragmented, manual, and inefficient.

This project documents the design of a workflow-driven incident resolution process that enables customer service officers (CSOs) to investigate and resolve OTP and SMS delivery issues through a single, structured portal.

The goal is to reduce resolution time, improve customer experience, and create a clear audit trail across internal systems and third-party vendors.
