### Objective

The objective of this project is to design a standardized, repeatable, and auditable process that:

- Centralizes OTP and SMS investigations into a single workflow

- Clearly separates human decisions from system checks

- Allows CSOs to classify issues accurately (OTP, SMS, or both)

- Supports structured vendor escalation

- Improves turnaround time and customer communication
